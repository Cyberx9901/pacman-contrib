pacman-contrib
==============

This repository contains contributed scripts to pacman.

*Note*: This used to be part of pacman.git, but was moved out to make pacman maintenance easier.


Scripts available in this repository:
-------------------------------------

* checkupdates - print a list of pending updates without touching the system
                 sync databases (for safety on rolling release distributions).

* updpkgsums - performs an in-place update of the checksums in a PKGBUILD.
